# R-Project-Exploring-TV-Viewership-and-Advertising-Costs-for-the-Super-Bowl

In this project, the dataset I used was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

I answered the following questions: 

1) What are the most extreme Super Bowl game outcomes?
2) How does point difference affect television viewership for the Super Bowl?
3) How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs for the Super Bowl evolved?
4) Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of Super Bowl halftime show performances?

Using the R-package tidyverse,  I imported and manipulated the datasets. To organize the data, I parsed them, simply labeling each column as a specific datatype. To inspect the datasets and check to see if there are any unknown or missing values, I summarized the datasets. 

This project also allowed me to apply other skills from several DataCamp courses such as ggplot2 visualization. This includes visualizing: a) a histogram of the distribution of combined points for each Super Bowl, b) a histogram of the difference in points between Super Bowl teams, and c) a scatter plot with a linear regression model showing the relationship between household viewership vs. point difference in Super Bowl game outcomes
